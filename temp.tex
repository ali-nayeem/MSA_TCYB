In Figure~\ref{fig:rank_best_fn_rate}, we compare the strength of five objective sets (\{Gap, SOP\}, \{SOP, TC\} , \{wSOP, TC\}, \{SimG, SimNG\} and \{Entropy, TC, Gap, SimG, SimNG, GapCon\}) based on FN rate. To accomplish this, For each set of objective functions, we run a suitable multi-objective metaheuristics (NSGA-II~\citep{deb2002fast}) for 20 times following the standard practice of operations research (OR) literature (due to the stochastic nature of metaheuristics). Each run generates a set of solutions that represents the trade-offs in satisfying all objectives. Afterwards, we inferred ML tree for each of the generated alignment. We collected the best FN rates from each of the 20 solution sets and describe the distribution of these FN rates using boxplots which are shown in Figure~\ref{fig:rank_best_fn_rate}. In these boxplots we also incorporate the FN rates achieved by the state-of-the-art tools for comparison using horizontal lines.
